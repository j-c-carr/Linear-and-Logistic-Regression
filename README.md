# Assignment 1

## Setup
1. Create a virtual environment and install the packages in `requirements.txt`

## Running the code
1. Open the notebook experiments_test.ipynb where all experiments are implemented in separate sections.

## Overview of files & folders:
1. `data/`: Contains the Boston housing and Wine datasets
2. `data_analysis`: Contains the code that was used to perform data analysis.
3. `models`: implementations of the linear, logisitc regression and SGD models. We even implemented the Adam model in `models/optimizers.py`
4. `experiments_test.ipynb`: Contains the code for the experiments that we ran on both datasets
5. `requirements.txt`: list of dependencies & libraries
